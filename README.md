## Description

A self-learning recipe website that allows users to upload and share recipes with each other.

## Motivation

The motaivation of this project was to build a mid level scale project that combines all my knowledges from Linux system, Database, Backend Server, and Frontend Technology. And at the same time to provide a place where I can keep notes of all my cooking recipes. (As I really like to cook, and keeping my recipes in Word documents doesn't seem ideal any more.)
